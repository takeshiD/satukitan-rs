# Task Completion Checklist
- Ensure `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` run cleanly.
- Run `cargo test` (or targeted tests) to confirm behavior once tests exist.
- For REPL/file execution changes, verify via `cargo run` interactively and against sample `.st` scripts.
- Review diffs with `git diff` before finalizing.
- Update documentation (e.g., `DESIGN.md`, `PLAN.md`, README) when language features change.
